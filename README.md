Crazy format ROM !

We do not have DMA, but we want fun!

This small source feature some format track routine (and even check/seek/calibration) with 15KHz replay sample

I documented enough the code but hey, you have to understand the basics of FDC programming to understand this ;)

You can put the ROM file anywhere between 8 and 15 slot (i did not test below 7)

Usage is Ã¹format or |format

There is NO confirmation, the floppy will be wiped! Use a test disc!

And have FUN !

See in action below
